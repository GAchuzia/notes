# uni-notes

4th-Year notes for Computer Systems Engineering at Carleton University.

> It would be *really* funny if I abandon this project in like 2 weeks.

## Preface

Looking for assignments or labs answers? You won't find any here! The point of this repo is to provide concise, complementary notes & flashcards to class lectures. Honestly I'm just hoping this motivates me to study so I don't fail (and to keep that sweet commit graph green)

## Flash Cards

### Anki

Anki is a powerful space-repetion based study tool. Download it from [Ankiweb](https://apps.ankiweb.net/#downloads), it's free (on desktop and android). I'll be uploading all the flash cards I make to this repo, and they can be found in the [anki-decksn folder](flashcards/anki-decks/).

### Quizlet

My favorite last-minute cramming tool. Follow the [Anki Export README](flashcards/ANKI_EXPORT_README.md#importing-to-quizlet) to see how you can import my Anki decks to Quizlet.
