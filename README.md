# Notes

General engineering notes.

> It would be *really* funny if I abandon this project in like 2 weeks.

## Preface

The point of this repo is to provide a bank of organized notes and flashcards I can easily refer to. Honestly I'm just hoping this motivates me to study (and to keep that sweet commit graph green).

## Course Notes

Notes based on lectures from my 4th year courses in Computer Systems Engineering at Carleton University.

## Flash Cards

### Anki

Anki is a powerful space-repetition based study tool. Download it from [Ankiweb](https://apps.ankiweb.net/#downloads), it's free (on desktop and android). I'll be uploading all the flash cards I make to this repo, and they can be found in the [anki-decks folder](flashcards/anki-decks/).

### Quizlet

My favorite cramming tool. Follow the [Anki Export README](flashcards/ANKI_EXPORT_README.md#importing-to-quizlet) to see how you can import my Anki decks to Quizlet.
