## 1. Course Introduction

### Course Philosophy

- SYSC 4805 - Computer System's Design Lab is a project-based course aimed at making small scale embedded systems through the collaboration of an engineering team.

- Spit into 3 parts:
  - Managing Engineering Projects
  - Technical Skills
  - Communication skills

### Learning Outcomes

1. Define concepts of product design, development methodology, and team-based project management.
2. Design an embedded microcontroller-based system for an engineering problem using hardware and software components.
3. Identify and adapt to realistic constraints.
4. Analyze potential solutions for an engineering project.
5. Use knowledge to analyze and solve an engineering problem.
6. Evaluate and predict performance using the Scientific method.
7. Define, plan, and manage a moderately complex project.
8. Develop teamwork and entrepreneurial skills.
9. Develop communication skills through technical presentations and reports.

### Project Generalities

- The goal of the project is to design and build a robotic platform containing:
  - Moving components
  - Sensors
  - Software that performs data fusion, decision making, processes sensor data, and uses the robot to solve a task.
- Project task is to use the robot to clear the snow off an enclosed are by a closed black path.
  - Robot most deal with fixed an moving obstacles without hitting them.

### Embedded System

- Class of computers that span a wide range of applications and performance.
- Embedded Systems split by  Application:
  - Automotive
  - Telecommunication
  - Healthcare
  - Industrial
  - Consumer Electronics
  - Military and Aerospace
  - Manufacturing

### Microcontroller vs Microprocessor

- Microcontroller's are all-in-one chips (containing CPU, memory, I/O peripherals, etc) designed for specific tasks (e.g Arduino).
- Microprocessors are powerful CPU's that need external memory and I/O to function. They are built for high-performance, general-purpose computing (e.g. Raspberry Pi).

### The Arduino Due

- A microcontroller with:
  - 32-bit ARm core @ 84 MHz clock
  - 512 Kb flash and 100 KB SRAM
  - 54 digital I/O pins
  - 12 PWM outputs (max 3.3V)
  - 12 Analog inputs (12-bit ADC, max 3.3V)
  - 2 Analog outputs (12-bit DAC)
  - USB, SPI, I2C, CAN, and UART interfaces
  - 9 32-bit timers
  - 3 low-power modes
  - ATmega16U2 microcontroller chip that acts as a bridge between the computer's USB and the main serial port
- Data sheet is SAM3X8E

### The Arduino Nano Every

- Based on the ATMega4809
- 8-bit AVR processor @ 20 MHz clock
- 48 KB Flash, 6 KB SRAM, 256B EEPROM
- 20 Digital input/output pins (Maximum 5V)
- 5 PWM outputs
- 8 Analog inputs (10-bit ADC) (Maximum 5V)
- No Analog outputs (only through PWM)
- Interfaces: USB, SPI, I2C, and UART
- 1 Timer (16-bit timer)
- Some low-power modes
- Almost all the pins are configurable by software.
- Also holds ATSAMD11D14A ARM Cortex-M0+ processor acts as a bridge
between USB and the main AVR processor

### Why Arduino?

- Stable and sturdy
- Faster development cycle
- Has built-in functions for directly working with microcontroller registers

### Sensors We Use

| Sensor | Description | Interface|
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Rover Line Follower | Analog on/off line detector/follower | Analog Output|
| Obstacle Detection IR Sensor | Digital on/off Obstacle detection | Digital Output|
| Laser Range Finder | Time-of-flight (TOF) range finder 4 - 400 cm| I2C|
| Ultrasonic | Distance measurement | Timer |
| Analog Distance Sensor | Distance measurement 2 - 15 cm | Analog Output|
| IMU | Gyro, Accelerometer and Compass | I2C |
| Wheel Encoder | Rotation degree of the wheels | Counters|

### Some Bad Stories

Examples where bad software led to catastrophes:

- 2022 Rogers Communication Outage: 25% of Canada lost internet connectivity
- 1997 Mars Pathfinder incident: Total system resets after landing, caused by faulty watchdog timer
- Therac-25 (1987): Bug in accepting commands led to machine being able to work in high power mode without shield (error displayed, unclear code number)
- 2009 Toyota Unintended Acceleration: Wide Open Throttle with no feet on pedal
- Boeing 737 MAX:  Lion Air Flight 610, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, angle-of-attack sensor falsely reports aircraft going to high, pushing nose down and causing aircraft to dive.

## 2. Project Management

### Definitions

- Project: A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result
  - Examples: Introducing a new car, upgrading models, merging two organizations
- Project management: The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to  project activities to meet the project requirements
- Knowledge area: A discipline or field of expertise in project management; groups together processes that share common subject matter
- Phase: A time-based division of the project life cycle (stages of project progression)
- Focus: What you need to know and manage in a project

### Goals of Project Management

1. Meet project objectives
2. Satisfy stakeholder expectations
3. More predictable
4. Increased chances of success, within schedule and budget
5. Identify and respond to risks
6. Identify, recover, or terminate failing projects

### How to Know Project Management was NOT Involved

1. Parts of project vary widely in quality and style (over and under
engineered)
2. Some features keep consuming resources when they should have
been killed
3. Essential processes are rushed or removed entirely (testing,
maintenance and upgrade plans)
4. Time schedules are based on actual coding time, nothing else

### Project Management Knowledge Areas

In accordance with the PMBOK Guide

- Project **Integration** Management
- Project **Scope** Management
- Project **Schedule** Management
- Project **Cost** Management
- Project **Quality** Management
- Project **Human Resource** Management
- Project **Communications** Management
- Project **Risk** Management
- Project **Procurement** Management
- Project **Stakeholder** Management

> Mnemonic: I See Smart Cool Humans Communicate Risks, Plans, Success

### Project Integration Management (Management Plan)

Identify, define, combine, unify, and coordinate the various processes and project management activities.

1. **Develop Project Charter:** Writing a document that formally authorizes the existence of a project
2. **Develop Project Management Plan:** Design/building plan components into integrated project management plan
3. **Direct and Manage Project Work:** Leading/performing work in project management plan to achieve project objectives
4. **Manage Project Knowledge:** Using existing knowledge to create new knowledge to achieve project objectives
5. **Monitor and Control Project Work:** Tracking/reviewing overall progress to meet objectives in the project management plan
6. **Perform Integrated Change Control:** Review, approve, and manage project changes while updating and communicating decisions.
7. **Close Project/Phase:** Finalizing all project/phase/contract activities

#### PM Integration: Definitions

- Project Charter: Paragraph description for; project purpose, objectives, success criteria, key deliverables, exit criteria
- Project Management Plan: Description of all documents on how the project will be executed/monitored/controlled/closed.

### Project Scope Management

Ensure the project plan only includes all the work required

1. **Plan Scope Management:** Creating scope management plan which documents how project scope is defined/validated/controlled
2. **Collect Requirements:** Documenting/managing stakeholder needs and requirements for project's objectives
3. **Define Scope:** Developing detailed description of the project and product
4. **Create WBS:** Subdividing deliverables into smaller manageable components
5. **Validate Scope:** Formalizing acceptance of completed deliverables
6. **Control Scope:** Monitoring status of project/product scope as well as changes to scope baseline

#### PM Scope: Definitions

- Product scope: Features and functions that characterize a product/service/result
- Project scope: Work performed to deliver a product/service/result with specified features/functions

#### PM Scope: Requirements

- A written agreement between customer and engineers on a projects functional/non-functional requirements
- Most important aspect of project
- Requirements Language:
  - **[Condition] [Subject] [Action] [Object] [Constraint of Action]**
    - Condition (optional): Condition under which requirements applies, generally starts with  "When"
    - Subject: The actor (e.g. the application, the system)
    - Action: The action of the requirement (e.g. shall return to, shall send)
    - Object (optional): Object of the action (e.g. a signal, message, particular state)
    - Constraint (optional): Restricts the action (e.g. time limit), generally uses "within"
