## 1. Lecture 1 - Course Introduction

### Course Philosophy

- SYSC 4805 - Computer System's Design Lab is a project-based course aimed at making small scale embedded systems through the collaboration of an engineering team.

- Spit into 3 parts:
  - Managing Engineering Projects
  - Technical Skills
  - Communication skills

## Learning Outcomes

1. Define concepts of product design, development methodology, and team-based project management.
2. Design an embedded microcontroller-based system for an engineering problem using hardware and software components.
3. Identify and adapt to realistic constraints.
4. Analyze potential solutions for an engineering project.
5. Use knowledge to analyze and solve an engineering problem.
6. Evaluate and predict performance using the Scientific method.
7. Define, plan, and manage a moderately complex project.
8. Develop teamwork and entrepreneurial skills.
9. Develop communication skills through technical presentations and reports.

## Project Generalities

- The goal of the project is to design and build a robotic platform containing:
  - Moving components
  - Sensors
  - Software that performs data fusion, decision making, processes sensor data, and uses the robot to solve a task.
- Project task is to use the robot to clear the snow off an enclosed are by a closed black path.
  - Robot most deal with fixed an moving obstacles without hitting them.

## Embedded System

- Class of computers that span a wide range of applications and performance.
- Embedded Systems split by  Application:
  - Automotive
  - Telecommunication
  - Healthcare
  - Industrial
  - Consumer Electronics
  - Military and Aerospace
  - Manufacturing

## Microcontroller vs Microprocessor

- Microcontroller's are all-in-one chips (containing CPU, memory, I/O peripherals, etc) designed for specific tasks (e.g Arduino)
- Microprocessors are powerful CPU's that need external memory and I/O to function. They are built for high-performance, general-purpose computing (e.g. Raspberry Pi).

## The Arduino Due

- A microcontroller with:
  - 32-bit ARm core @ 84 MHz clock
  - 512 Kb flash and 100 KB SRAM
  - 54 digital I/O pins
  - 12 PWM outputs (max 3.3V)
  - 12 Analog inputs (12-bit ADC, max 3.3V)
  - 2 Analog outputs (12-bit DAC)
  - USB, SPI, I2C, CAN, and UART interfaces
  - 9 32-bit timers
  - 3 low-power modes
  - ATmega16U2 microcontroller chip that acts as a bridge between the computer's USB and the main serial port.
- Data sheet os SAM3X8E

## The Arduino Nano Every
